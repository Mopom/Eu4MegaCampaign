russian_highway.1.t:0 "Siberian Pathway Construction in [Root.GetName]"
russian_highway.1.da:0 "The first steps in the construction of the Siberian Pathway in [Root.GetName] have been made. Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further bodies to continue the project."
russian_highway.1.db:0 "The construction of the Siberian Pathway is showing great advancement! Over the last few weeks the foundation of rubble and gravel has been bound together and reinforced with a layer of cement, turning the path into what can start to truly be described as a road. Preparations are already being made for the final step: Paving. However the costs of suitable stone are high and the overseers of [Root.GetName] say they need more bodies to take the final step."
russian_highway.1.dc:0 "The sun shines brightly upon the highway in [Root.GetName]. Its flagstones give off a golden shimmer in the late afternoon as the first merchants start their journeys along the rebuilt marvel. It is wide enough for six men to march abreast and two carts to pass eachother comfortably. It is already a great asset in [Root.GetName] and even so it is but a small link in a long chain that will strengthen our nation. Future generations will marvel at these roads."
