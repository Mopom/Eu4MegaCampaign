 embassy_fed.12.desc:1 "The idea of sending an embassy to the distant lands was set to look for our old Queen's family. After so many years, we are sure that we have found the land where they came from. That could also give us a legitimate claim in the eyes of our people to those distant, but rich, lands, where we could also establish a foothold on the Asian mainland. My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], should we pursue these ambitious claims?"

 embassy_fed.13.t:1 "Londen and the Federation"
 embassy_fed.13.desc:1 "100 years ago, the Federation rulers began a concerted push to take direct control of the Lowlands and the trade areas around the English channel, following a prolonged period of financial difficulties. Despite some difficulties in Holland, the endeavour was successful, with the last disloyal vassal dying at the bottom of a dungeon in Goslar. The question of England remained however. Aymar, our current king, devised a scheme 5 years ago, triggering a rebellion in Londen, and using it as a pretext to occupy the province 'temporarily, to establish order'. Now our English vassal has come to us, demanding we cede control once again of that important trading hub."
