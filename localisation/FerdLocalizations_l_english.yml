#TNF Embassy
flavor_gng.1.t:0 "Send an embassy to Ganga?"
 flavor_gng.1.desc:0 "Some stories and legends recount a tale of a adventure of a Gangan woman who travelled far into our lands to spread the word of the river worship. We now are river worshipers, perhaps we shall learn of this past? Then, my Triuwianradgewo, shall we send an embassy to this overseas, far away land, to ascertain if these stories are true? Or maybe it's a risk sending them into the mainland, and we should be content with our ongoing trade activity in known seas?"
 flavor_gng.1.a:0 "Send an ambassador to Ganga"
 flavor_gng.1.a.tt:1 "We will ask §Y[552.Owner.GetName]§! to establish a [Root.GetAdjective] embassy in §Y[552.GetName]§! in exchange for a [552.Owner.GetAdjective] embassy in §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§!.\n[552.Owner.GetName] might refuse completely if their Relition is NOT §YGangan§!."
 flavor_gng.1.b:1 "It's not really worth it"
 flavor_gng.2.t:0 "A [From.GetAdjective] ambassador meets us"
 flavor_gng.2.desc:0 "My lord, an embassy coming from a distant land to the east in the ocean, that some name Sax, says that they have come to our country to gather information about the origins of their past, of a  Gangan woman. Should we accept this embassy, establishing a regular diplomatic relationship with them?"
 flavor_gng.2.a:0 "Welcome him!"
 flavor_gng.2.b:0 "We have no need for diplomacy with The Northern Federation"
 flavor_gng.3.t:0 "Ganga welcomes our embassy!"
 flavor_gng.3.desc:0 "Great news, my Emperor! Our ambassador sent to Delhi has sent us news about them reaching a country named [From.GetAdjective], which was eager to establish diplomatic relations with our country."
 flavor_gng.3.a:0 "Very kind on their part!"
 flavor_gng.4.t:0 "Ganga expelled the ambassador!"
 flavor_gng.4.desc:0 "Bad news, my Triuwianradgewo! Our embassy reached the distant land of [From.GetAdjective], but their ruler was narrow minded enough to reject our story, and expel our people from their country."
 flavor_gng.5.a:0 "Oh, those filthy bastards!"
 flavor_gng.5.t:0 "The Destruction of the [embassy_owner.GetAdjective] Embassy"
 flavor_gng.5.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, we lost the [embassy_owner.GetAdjective] Embassy! Our connection with [embassy_owner.GetName] has been severed. Only time will tell how this will impact our relation..."
 flavor_gng.5.a:0 "That's not good..."
 flavor_gng.5.b:0 "That's not good..."
 flavor_gng.6.t:1 "[From.GetName] lost the [Root.GetAdjective] embassy!"
 flavor_gng.6.desc:0 "My lord, we have lost contact with the embassy sent by the people of Sax. We do not fully understand the reasons behind this; some say that they returned to their country, others that they wanted to travel to other distant lands. Probably we will ever know about their fate."
 flavor_gng.6.a:0 "Oh, what a waste of time!"
 flavor_gng.7.t:1 "[From.GetName] lost the [Root.GetAdjective] embassy!"
 flavor_gng.7.desc:1 "My lord, that foreign embassy sent by the people of Zanj has been recently disbanded. It's strange they refused to stay here, after having traveled for so long and from so far away."
 flavor_gng.7.a:0 "These people were strange ones."
 flavor_gng.8.t:1 "Our merchants visit [OppositeEmbassyHolderName]"
 flavor_gng.8.desc:1 "The embassy we established in the distant lands of [OppositeEmbassyHolderName] has revealed interesting people to trade with. Also, recently some of our merchants have also been visiting those lands, changing some of our trade goods for theirs, and earning some interesting profits with these travels."
 flavor_gng.8.a:0 "It's always nice to get some goodies and money!"
 flavor_gng.9.t:1 "Knowledge Sharing with [OppositeEmbassyHolderName]"
 flavor_gng.9.desc:1 "The trade route established by our merchants with the distant country of [OppositeEmbassyHolderName] has paid off the effort of establishing our embassy there. But apart from trade goods and money, there is something more interesting that has begun to be shared between our two peoples: ideas. Thus, it has been very beneficial for the development of our country in the past few years, my sultan."
 flavor_gng.9.a:0 "Sharing new ideas is always worth it."
 flavor_gng.10.t:0 "Religious Interactions"
 flavor_gng.10.desc:1 "The embassy established some years ago has also given us some information about the beliefs of the people in [OppositeEmbassyHolderName], which is not so different from our own beliefs. That has also stimulated the work of our religious scholars, benefiting the worship of religion in our country, and the piety of believers, my sultan."
 flavor_gng.10.a:1 "Religion connects our both realms."
 flavor_gng.11.t:1 "The Influence of [OppositeEmbassyHolderReligion]"
 flavor_gng.11.desc:1 "The years of religious talk between the scholars of our country and those of [OppositeEmbassyHolderName] have deeply influenced our beliefs. Now a stream of thought has emerged among our scholars, saying that our religion is not so different from theirs. Then, an important question arises from these thoughts. Would it be more beneficial for our country to officially embrace the religion of long-time friends, thus further strengthening our relationship?"
 flavor_gng.11.a:1 "[OppositeEmbassyHolderReligion] shall be our new faith."
 flavor_gng.11.b:0 "We shall keep our own beliefs, thanks."
 flavor_gng.12.t:1 "The Claims of Shirazi's Descendants"
 flavor_gng.12.desc:1 "The idea of sending an embassy to the distant lands of [OppositeEmbassyHolderName] was set to look for the origins of Shirazi people. After so many years, we are sure that we have found the land where they came from. That could also give us a legitimate claim in the eyes of our people to those distant, but rich, lands, where we could also establish a foothold on the Asian mainland. My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], should we pursue these ambitious claims?"
#Silk Road
golden_highway.1.t:0 "Silk Road Construction in [Root.GetName]"
golden_highway.1.da:0 "The first steps in the construction of the Silk Road in [Root.GetName] have been made. Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further funding to continue the project."
golden_highway.1.db:0 "The construction of the Silk Road is showing great advancement! Over the last few weeks the foundation of rubble and gravel has been bound together and reinforced with a layer of cement, turning the path into what can start to truly be described as a road. Preparations are already being made for the final step: Paving. However the costs of suitable stone are high and the overseers of [Root.GetName] say they need more coin totake the final step."
golden_highway.1.dc:0 "The sun shines brightly upon the highway in [Root.GetName]. Its flagstones give off a golden shimmer in the late afternoon as the first merchants start their journeys along the rebuilt marvel. It is wide enough for six men to march abreast and two carts to pass eachother comfortably. It is already a great asset in [Root.GetName] and even so it is but a small link in a long chain that will strengthen our nation. Future generations will marvel at these roads, like we marveled at them in Jaher's time."
golden_highway.1.a:0 "A splendid advancement!"
golden_highway.1.b:0 "Pause it for now, we don't have the funds."
golden_highway.1.c:0 "It's complete!"
golden_highway.2.t:0 "Resuming the Silk Road Construction in [Root.GetName]"
golden_highway.2.d:0 "The construction of the Silk Road in [Root.GetName] has laid dormant for quite some time now. It will require some upfront investment but the local magistrates have requested the continuation of the project as it will provide local jobs and be better for their merchants in the long run. They have even gone through the effort of gathering funds to alleviate some of the costs!"
golden_highway.2.a:0 "Be sure to make it glitter!"
golden_highway.2.b:0 "It's too expensive"
