Recently, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Robespierre held a particularly violent speech, in which he denounced and demanded the arrest of traitors in the Committees of Public Safety and General Security. This has caused widespread fear and outrage among the leaders of the Revolution, who fear yet another purge of their ranks. Already the National Assembly is moving to demand his arrest and curb the worst excesses of his Reign of Terror, returning stability to the realm and ensuring that no one may use the chaos as an excuse to restore the monarchy.\n\nHowever, it seems that Robespierre still has many supporters who will surely seek to protect him if we do not move swiftly."

In the eyes of the Committee of Public Safety, this makes [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] a dangerous reactionary and an Enemy of the People, one that it would be dangerous to leave alive."
ganga_revolution.301.desc2:0 "It is not clear what Chief [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle] [Root.GetEventAdvisorName] did to attract the ire of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but the Committee of Public Safety has nevertheless identified [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] as a potential reactionary. Just in case their suspicions are accurate, they recommend execution by guillotine."
ganga_revolution.301.desc3:0 "It seems that one of the members of the Committee of Public Safety overheard [Root.GetEventAdvisorName], [Root.GetUsableName]'s Chief [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle], making incriminating remarks to a suspected counter-revolutionary.

However, revolutionary forces intercepted her before she could cross the border.\n\nThis has emboldened all those who despise the monarchy and wish to permanently rid us of their scourge. They have hauled her before the National Assembly to face trial over charges of having conspired with foreign powers and thus being a traitor. If found guilty, she will be forced to abdicate, be stripped of all titles and face execution by guillotine. However, tensions are running high and the vote is likely be a close one."

He justifies this by claiming that restoring the hereditary succession would make it harder to restore the former Emperors of India to power - after all, there have been several royalist plots on his life - but there is little doubt that his prime motivation is to further his own ambitions for supreme power. The proposal has met with widespread support among the populace, who yearn for the relative stability of the pre-revolutionary years; however, diehard supporters of the Revolution express worry at this attempt to concentrate even more power in Palpat's hands."

Many are increasingly losing faith in the Republic as a result."

flavor_gan.EVTDESC113:1 "The national debt is a problem in the eyes of the people. The country's finances seem to be in no better shape than before the shift of government, and many fear a costly default or rising taxes. The faith in the Republic is dwindling and many are turning back to old monarchist ways."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC114:1 "The Revolution seems to have ground to a halt. With more than a quarter of the country in revolt, few now believe that the republican government holds the answers to our nation's problems."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC115:1 "Those who thought that the Revolution and the Republic would be the answers to the instability of [Root.GetName] are becoming more and more disillusioned.

Support is growing for a strong leader to take over control and enforce an end to the chaos."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC116:1 "The People's faith in the Republic is declining.
