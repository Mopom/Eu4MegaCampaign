 golden_highway.1.t:0 "Golden Highway Construction in [Root.GetName]"
 golden_highway.1.da:0 "The first steps in the restoration of the golden highway in [Root.GetName] have been made. Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. The foundations have been restored where they still existed and built anew where time had wiped them away entirely. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. With more time and effort the roads of Jaher will be returned to their former glory and we will reap the benefits. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further funding to continue the project."
 golden_highway.1.db:0 "The restoration of the golden highway is showing great advancement! Over the last few weeks the foundation of rubble and gravel has been bound together and reinforced with a layer of cement, turning the path into what can start to truly be described as a road. Preparations are already being made for the final step: Paving. However the costs of suitable stone are high and the overseers of [Root.GetName] say they need more coin totake the final step."
 golden_highway.1.dc:0 "The sun shines brightly upon the highway in [Root.GetName]. Its flagstones give off a golden shimmer in the late afternoon as the first merchants start their journeys along the rebuilt marvel. It is wide enough for six men to march abreast and two carts to pass eachother comfortably. It is already a great asset in [Root.GetName] and even so it is but a small link in a long chain that will strengthen our nation. Future generations will marvel at these roads, like we marveled at them in Jaher's time."

It will require some upfront investment but the local magistrates have requested the continuation of the project as it will provide local jobs and be better for their merchants in the long run. They have even gone through the effort of gathering funds to alleviate some of the costs!"
