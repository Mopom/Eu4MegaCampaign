  #The Prophet
  rhenism.1.t:0 "The Church and the Prophet"
  rhenism.1.d:0 "The Rhenist faithful have begun to question the status of the Prophet Muhammad within their religion. Though Rhenists alone amongst Christians heed the word of the Prophet, there has never been clear theological consensus as to whether his word is that of the Lord, or whether it is just the teaching of a wise man.\nAfter much debate over the exact interpretation of the Bible and Quran, the priests within our country have reached a rough consensus."
  rhenism.1.a:0 "The Prophet's words may be wise, but they are just those of a man."
  rhenism.1.b:0 "The Lord has clearly called the Prophet as one of his messengers."
  rhenism.1.c:0 "The Word of Muhammad, peace be upon him, reigns supreme!"
