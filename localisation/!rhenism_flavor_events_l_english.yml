  #The Prophet
  rhenism.1.t:0 "The Church and the Prophet"
  rhenism.1.d:0 "The Rhenist faithful have begun to question the status of the Prophet Muhammad within their religion. Though Rhenists alone amongst Christians heed the word of the Prophet, there has never been clear theological consensus as to whether his word is that of the Lord, or whether it is just the teaching of a wise man.\nAfter much debate over the exact interpretation of the Bible and Quran, the priests within our country have reached a rough consensus."
  rhenism.1.a:0 "The Prophet's words may be wise, but they are just those of a man"
  rhenism.1.b:0 "The Lord has clearly called the Prophet as one of his messengers"
  rhenism.1.c:0 "The Word of Muhammad, peace be upon him, reigns supreme!"

  #The blessed sacrament
  rhenism.3.t:0 "On the Blessed Sacrament"
  rhenism.3.d:0 "Since the time of Jesus, nearly all churches have held that the bread and wine truly become Christ's body and blood when preparing the Blessed Sacrament. Our forefathers believed that the Body of Christ is substantially present in the Eucharist.\n\nSome priests throughout the Rhenist communion have started to question this doctrine, with the most radical painting others as cannibals. Though debate still echos through our churches and cathedrals, most believers in our country have settled on a consensus."
  rhenism.3.a:0 "Christ is truly present in the Eucharist"
  rhenism.3.b:0 "Christ's presence is only spiritual"
  rhenism.3.c:0 "The Lord's Supper is simply symbolic bread and wine"
  
  #The Edict of Konstanz
  rhenism.5.t:0 "The Edict of Konstanz"
  rhenism.5.d:0 "At all times the Federation has been uncaring of one's faith, as long as they believed in the Federation. Their own leaders have been very prone to converting to different religions that interested them. However, anyone and anything threatening the unity of the Federation has always been brutally repressed. It is now time to take a decision on these issues, and either adopt a more tolerant attitude towards other cultures, or keep oppressing and converting them away."
  rhenism.5.a:0 "Tolerance is the way forwards"
  rhenism.5.b:0 "Others threaten the unity of the Federation"
