 rus_yamesnikov.2.t:0 "Yamesnikov offers to train our heir in military matters."
 rus_yamesnikov.2.d:0 "After having observed our heir for a while now, Yamesnikov has told the Tsar that he think the heir is perfectly suited for training in the military to become a general. He has also said that, if the Tsar accepts, he will perosnally oversee the training and try to get him to be the best general he could be."
 rus_yamesnikov.2.a:0 "Let him train our heir, this couldn't possibly go wrong!"
 rus_yamesnikov.2.b:0 "I would prefer him to be kept safe, away from the battlefield."
 
 rus_yamesnikov.3.t:0 "Heir dies in a training accident!"
 rus_yamesnikov.3.d:0 "During a regular training excercise our heir accidentally got shot because he loaded his rifel incorrectly, and it exploded in his hands and shot the bullet backwards. Our heir is now dead, but do we hold Yamesnikov accountable? On one hand he was supposed to oversee the excercise, so it is partially his fault that he didn't see this. On the other hand this is a freak accident so Yamesnikov didn't cause it himself. Another problem is that the populace will be angry if we punish Yamesnikov for this."
 rus_yamesnikov.3.a:0 "I knew we should have kept him home! Let Yamesnikov off the hook, he couldn't have seen this comming either."
 rus_yamesnikov.3.b:0 "Reprimand him immidiatly, he shall pay for the death of my heir!"
 
 rus_yamesnikov.4.t:0 "A new heir is born!"
 rus_yamesnikov.4.d:0 "Glorious days! A new heir has been born. The Tsarina has come with the novel idea of naming our best and most loved general, Yamesnikov, as the godfather of this new child."
 rus_yamesnikov.4.a:0 "That's a lovely idea, i think we should do it."
 rus_yamesnikov.4.b:0 "What!? That traitor killed our previous son, why should we involve him with this one aswell?"
 
 rus_yamesnikov.5.t:0 "The emperor is dead!"
 rus_yamesnikov.5.d:0 "After a sudden heart attack the king has died. When his will was read it said that he wanted Yamesnikov to care for his son and to teach him all matter military so that he could grow up stronger. But the queen has disagreed with this stating that he obviously would have wanted her to take over as regent. What shall we do?"
 rus_yamesnikov.5.a:0 "Yamesnikov, his godfather, shall be the new regent!"
 rus_yamesnikov.5.b:0 "Obviously it should be the queen, it is her own child after all."
 
 rus_yamesnikov.6.t:0 "Revolutionary middle class flares up in the east"
 rus_yamesnikov.6.d:0 "In recent months revolutionary action by the new middle class has seen a significant uptick due too the percieved weakness of the central goverment. Yamesnikov has now consolidated enough power to begin doing something about it."
 rus_yamesnikov.6.a:0 "Reacting to harshly may lead to bad consiquences, we shoul try to contain them but not attack them too harsly, eventualy it will fizzle out"
 rus_yamesnikov.6.b:0 "We will begin an immidiate, harsh crackdown on their activities"
 
 rus_yamesnikov.7.t:0 "Revolutionary middle class kills local nobles"
 rus_yamesnikov.7.d:0 "The revolutionaries have killed a few of the local nobels in the east in an attept to coup the local government there, thankfully the coup was averted but the nobels are still dead. How are we going to deal with this?"
 rus_yamesnikov.7.a:0 "Yamesnikov urges us to not handle too harshly as it will only agitate them more"
 rus_yamesnikov.7.b:0 "The young Tsar tells us to crush them quickly and harshly to show them what happens when you try to threaten the crown!"
 
 rus_yamesnikov.8.t:0 "Revolutionary middle class is massacared"
 rus_yamesnikov.8.d:0 "The revolutionaries staged a peacefull protest outside of one of the government buildings in the west. In acordance with the orders we gave them the local troops immidiatly tried to disperse the crowd, with middeling succes. Then, a gunshot went of. It is unknow if the soldiers or the revolutionaries fired first, but it also doesn't really matter as the revolutionaries had no chance against the soldiers, they were massacered. In the aftermath Yamesnikov has urged the government to no listen to the underage Tsar and instead handel the revolution with care."
 rus_yamesnikov.8.a:0 "We should push ahead, we can't let the revolutionaries get ahead of us. A few may die, but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make."
 rus_yamesnikov.8.b:0 "Maybe we should've listened to Yamesnikov, we can't keep massacaring our own people!"
 
 rus_yamesnikov.9.t:0 "Assasination of the Tsar!"
 rus_yamesnikov.9.d:0 "Today a tradgedy has struck! Whilst the Tsar was touring the country, a revolutionary ran out from the crowd and shot him in the chest 3 times before the soldiers could stop him. The Tsar died at that moment. Ever since the government has been in abject chaos, especially because revolutionaries have siezed the oppertunity to surround the government buildings and demand a peacfull handover of power to them."
 rus_yamesnikov.9.a:0 "The revolutionaries succeed and a revolutionary republic is declared! Long live the revolution!"
 rus_yamesnikov.9.b:0 "Yamesnikov saves the day! He rides in with his cavilry regiment and manages to break through the revolutionaries lines!"
