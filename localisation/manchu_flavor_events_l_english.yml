  manchu_japanese.3.d:0 "The people of Greater Wang, and, more specifically, of Furdan, wish to convert to our Japanese culture. It is up to us whether we accept them or not. How Japanese can these horse-riding ruffians truly be."
  manchu_japanese.3.a:0 "They are truly Japanese."
  manchu_japanese.3.b:0 "We cannnot fully consider them Japanese. But maybe they could be considered japanised."
  manchu_japanese.3.c:0 "This abomination bears no resemblance to any Japanese culture."

  manchu_japanese.5.t:0 "Japanese Smuggling and Piracy"
  manchu_japanese.5.d:0 "Across the Strait of Soya pirates and smugglers have been active for decades. First it was the Ainu, then the Togoku, and now even the Japanese smuggle. And long have we been able to tolerate this but now the smugglings are Japanising our mainland."
  manchu_japanese.5.a:0 "Damn these smugglers!"
  manchu_japanese.5.b:0 "Maybe God has granted a sign..."

  manchu_japanese.6.t:0 "The Japanese of Wolanhe"
  manchu_japanese.6.d:0 "In Wolanhe smugglers have been uncovered and now it seems they are true subjects of the Emperor. What they did they had no right to do but now it seems the Taipongel are adopting traditions of ours. And they have the gall to call themselves Japanese."
  manchu_japanese.6.a:0 "They're Japanese enough."
  manchu_japanese.6.b:0 "Perhaps we could expel our Togoku smugglers there."
  manchu_japanese.6.c:0 "A new home for the Ainu."

  manchu_japanese.9.t:0 "Mongolian Pretenders"
  manchu_japanese.9.d:0 "Taipongel pretenders have claimed our glorious culture as their own. We must visit to see if they are truly as Japanese as the subjects to our Tenno and Shogun."

  #Beijing
  manchu_japanese.11.t:0 "The Harbour of Beijing"
  manchu_japanese.11.d:0 "In the habours of Tianjin live a plentitude of Japanese. So many live here that an entire quarter of the city has been sectioned off as Japan-town. Many of the Japanese here have settled after earning a pretty penny in the trade of the Bohai and Korean Seas. Already they are with many, would it not be easiest to accept their culture on the mainland?"
  manchu_japanese.11.a:0 "No, Beijing is for the Chinese."
  manchu_japanese.11.b:0 "Indeed, we should accept the Saigoku."

  manchu_japanese.12.d:0 "Taipongel Khagans have told us, in their diplomatic missions, of Saigoku in Pekin. Perhaps we could recall these traders of our Throne, or maybe we could cut a deal with the Khagans."
  manchu_japanese.12.a:0 "We'll cut a deal with these Khagans."
  manchu_japanese.12.b:0 "Recall the Imperial Merchants!"

  #Cicigar
  manchu_japanese.14.t:0 "Saigoku on the Steppe"
  manchu_japanese.14.d:0 "Long, yet slowly, the Japanese have influenced the Taipongel of our Great Horde. Now they've even left their coastal homes behind and spread their culture to the steppes. It is clear that colonisation was their only intent."
  manchu_japanese.14.a:0 "Drat! Is it too late to stop them?"
  manchu_japanese.14.b:0 "Perhaps these colonisations aren't as bad as they seem."
