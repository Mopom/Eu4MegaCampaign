  manchu_japanese.5.d:0 "Across the Strait of Soya pirates and smugglers have been active for decades. First it was the Ainu, then the Togoku, and now even the Japanese smuggle. And long have we been able to tolerate this but now the smugglings are Japanising our mainland."
  manchu_japanese.5.a:0 "Damn these smugglers!"
  manchu_japanese.5.b:0 "Maybe God has granted a sign..."

  manchu_japanese.6.d:0 "In Wolanhe smugglers have been uncovered and now it seems they are true subjects of the Emperor. What they did they had no right to do but now it seems the Taipongel are adopting traditions of ours. And they have the gall to call themselves Japanese."
  manchu_japanese.6.a:0 "They're Japanese enough."
  manchu_japanese.6.b:0 "Perhaps we could expel our Togoku smugglers there."
  manchu_japanese.6.c:0 "A new home for the Ainu."
