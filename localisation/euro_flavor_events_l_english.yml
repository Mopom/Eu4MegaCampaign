  catholics_and_colonies.2.d:0 "For many years our sovereigns have faced away from the Catholic Church. They lost faith in our Supreme Pontiff and turned to the Heresy of Rhenism. Praise be to God that they have returned to the Catholic fold. However, the retribution of their betrayal yet rests and for this the Vicar of Christ would demand the City of Avignon. In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctus."
  catholics_and_colonies.2.a:0 "Avignon is a cheap retribution to pay."
  catholics_and_colonies.2.b:0 "We shall not surrender our sovereign territory!"
