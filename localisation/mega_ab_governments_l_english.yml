 flavor_adu.4.t:0 "Unification of Andalusia"
 flavor_adu.2.d:0 "The treatment of the native population in our colonies has become the subject of great debate among the [Root.Culture.GetName] intellectuals. An imam named Bartolomé de las Casas have made himself the spokesman of the natives and demand that we recognize their free will to receive Allah rather than force them into slavery and compelled conversions. The discussion has been going on for some time in various publications and has now culminated in a great debate being held in Valladolid at the request of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nLas Casas main opponent, Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, argues that the natives are naturally disposed towards slavery and that this is the only sure way to get them to stop their barbaric customs of cannibalism and human sacrifice in order to make them convert to the true faith."
 flavor_adu.4.d:0 "Up until now the Andalusian [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has technically been the ruler of many states that together have been known as al-Andalus. With the recent centralization of the government, however, and the creation of a new type of Parliament in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has suggested that it is time that we abolish the power of the local courts of the Spanish states. While this will not be an easy undertaking the alternative is to risk having the local courts stifle our new Parliamentary system with their old provincial interests."
 flavor_adu.4.a:0 "One court for a United Andalusia."
 flavor_adu.11.d:0 "The Andalusian Colonial Empire is one of the oldest in the world and as such has one of the oldest systems of administration. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently taken an interest in how the government of the colonies might be improved in order to increase our revenue extraction from them. The advisors of [Root.Monarch.GetName] are all men of the Enlightenment and have suggested a number of ways to improve the situation, among other things the colonies should be allowed to trade freely rather than through a few select ports, Intendants appointed directly by the crown should be sent out to ensure the efficiency and honesty of our administration and tax reductions for vital sectors might stimulate the growth of the colonial economies."
