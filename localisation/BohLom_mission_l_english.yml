 ubl_4_1_desc:0 "To the east, in the Carpathian Basin, lies the Kingdom of Hungary. Our vassal, [SLO.GetName], seems perfectly situated for expansion here. And control over the basin would strenghten the position of our crown."
 ubl_4_2_title:0 "Bohemian Crystal"
 ubl_4_2_desc:0 "The production of an especially beautiful style of glasswork has become popular in our realm. We should promote this industry and ensure that our works are prized throughout the courts of Europe."

It is time to grant them a home again, in the foothills of Silesia."
 ubl_4_6_title:0 "Eine neue Bergordnung"
 ubl_4_6_desc:0 "New uses for coal are being discovered that could revolutionize the face of industry throughout the world. We should reform our mining laws so that we can start producing coal at peak efficiency."
