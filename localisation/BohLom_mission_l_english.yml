 ubl_2_1_title:0 "All of Lombardy"
 ubl_2_1_desc:0 "With the special rights the §YDukes of Bologna§! posture themselves as semi-sovereign vassals. This is hardly in line with the majority of our other crown vassals and cannot be tolerated much longer.

 ubl_2_2_title:0 "Premyslids in Wales"
 ubl_2_2_desc:0 "In the 13th century we expanded the holdings of our dynasty across the continent.

And in Lower Bosnia and Dubrovnik we installed, respectively, the Duke Jan I and the Duke Karel I.

 ubl_3_1_desc:0 "Our vassals have always been strong, and big. And always with their size they have treatened the authority of our crowns. But after long-term diplomacy it seems we have attained the loyalty of all our current vassals. Though who is to say how long these loyalties will last."

 ubl_3_3_title:0 "The Alpine Line"

 ubl_3_4_desc:0 "After the success of mountain forts in the Alps let us expand our practice to the fortify the weakest front of our nation; the Carpathian Basin. In both the §YCarpathian Mountains§! and the §YDinaric Alps§! we shall build heavy fortifications."

 ubl_4_1_title:0 "Conquest of Hungary"
 ubl_4_1_desc:0 "To the east, in the Carpathian Basin, lies the Kingdom of Hungary. Our vassal, [SLO.GetName], seems perfectly situated for expansion here. And control over the basin would strenghten the position of our crown."
 ubl_4_2_title:0 "Bohemian Crystal"
 ubl_4_2_desc:0 "The production of an especially beautiful style of glasswork has become popular in our realm. We should promote this industry and ensure that our works are prized throughout the courts of Europe."
 ubl_4_3_title:0 "Silk in Como"
 ubl_4_3_desc:0 "With the knowledge and development of the Swiss culture growing greater and greater over the past year development, or adoption, of new technologies has spread in the realm. Already silk, an Asian good, is produced in Como."
 ubl_4_4_title:0 "Inspiring the Peasants"
 ubl_4_4_desc:0 "If we build in Prague a great church or cathedral it could inspire faith and diligent values in the peasantry of our realm. And inspired diligence surely leads to an increased wealth."
 ubl_4_5_title:0 "Silesia for the Polish"
 ubl_4_5_desc:0 "The attack, in the 14th century, by the §YTsaritsa Yekaterina II§!, on Poland was brutal and inhumane. In it's wake it left many Poles dead, with many more displaced and seeking refuge. Some small communities survived on the stretching plains but only through the §YMines of Wieliczka§! and our charity did bigger communities survive. It is time to grant them a home again, in the foothills of Silesia."
 ubl_4_6_title:0 "Eine neue Bergordnung"
 ubl_4_6_desc:0 "New uses for coal are being discovered that could revolutionize the face of industry throughout the world. We should reform our mining laws so that we can start producing coal at peak efficiency."

 ubl_4_7_desc:0 "We have based our strength on the prosperity of our homeland. Political leadership will surely swiftly follow economic supremacy."
 ubl_5_1_title:0 "A Republic for Nobles?"
 ubl_5_1_desc:0 "With the succession crisis befalling the House of Premyslid we were forced into a new form of governance. And though it seems we have weathered the storm both the Premyslids and the realm-nobles are still discovering their positions and allegiances."
 ubl_5_2_title:0 "Bohemian Diligence"
 ubl_5_2_desc:0 "If we wish to prove ourselves equal to our European brethren we must do our diligent work and catch them in stride."
 ubl_5_3_title:0 "Aldine Monopoly"
 ubl_5_3_desc:0 "The printing presses of Venezia run wild, as new books wash up on it's shores."
 ubl_5_4_title:0 "Professional Doctors"
 ubl_5_4_desc:0 "With a university we might educate our intellegent in the sciences of law, theology, mathematics, and perhaps most importantly in medicine. The institutions will not only be beacons of knowledge but also guardians over the health of our monarchs."
 ubl_5_5_title:0 "Slava Praze"
 ubl_5_5_desc:0 "Prague is our great city. It is our capital and the centre of our might and empire. Many a foreigner seeks out the streets of Prague in their tales and they are right in this."
 ubl_1_7_new_title:0 "Slavic Industrialisation"
 ubl_1_7_new_desc:0 "With us promising prosperity in both cultures of our realm it would we wise to teach the Slavs the way of technology. Specifically the Slovakia area of in the Northern Carpathian Basin fits this bill well, and perhaps even the Silesian hills and fields would welcome the tides of change."
 ubl_1_8_new_title:0 "Holy Ragusa"
 ubl_1_8_new_desc:0 "Ragusa is an important city among the Slavs, and with their newfound wealth they have financed great projects in this, their Holy Site."
 ubl_2_5_new_title:0 "Two Crowns over One"
 ubl_2_5_new_desc:0 "In our state we follow a very dual system. We are christian but we will not force it upon others. We are an empire and yet a republic. We are European and yet we look outside of it. And perhaps most of all, we are Slavs and we are Latin."
 ubl_2_6_new_title:0 "Italo-Slavic Brotherhood"
 ubl_2_6_new_desc:0 "As we are both Slavic and Latin we might improve for both our cultures. In Italy the Latins shall have their development, and in Bohemia the Slavics shall have their development. Through individual investment the entire nation might be brought forward."
 ubl_2_7_new_title:0 "Milan, a Second City"
 ubl_2_7_new_desc:0 "Milan, in the north of Italy, or the heart of Lombardy, has long been the seat of our power over the Latin peoples. It was from here that our Governors of Switzerland ruled over the banks of the Po river. Perhaps, with all integrated in our great realm, we might return Milan as a city to celebrate the Latin people."
 ubl_2_8_new_title:0 "Venetian Free Port"
 ubl_2_8_new_desc:0 "Ever since we were granted the feudal contract over Venice by the §YKaiserin Rodelinda I of the Northern Federation§! its wealth has ceaselessly grown. And though the nobles of that realm eye, hungrily, the riches of Venice our feudal contract protects us. But what protects Venice? It's arsenal of course!"
