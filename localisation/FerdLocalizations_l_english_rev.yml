ganga_revolution.4.skysky:0 "The Reign of Terror has seen countless Frenchmen massacred in the name of the Republic. No sooner has one threat been eliminated then the next is identified and purged. Recently, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Robespierre held a particularly violent speech, in which he denounced and demanded the arrest of traitors in the Committees of Public Safety and General Security. This has caused widespread fear and outrage among the leaders of the Revolution, who fear yet another purge of their ranks. Already the National Assembly is moving to demand his arrest and curb the worst excesses of his Reign of Terror, returning stability to the realm and ensuring that no one may use the chaos as an excuse to restore the monarchy.\n\nHowever, it seems that Robespierre still has many supporters who will surely seek to protect him if we do not move swiftly."
ganga_revolution.4.skysky.A:0 "Arrest Skysky!"
ganga_revolution.4.skysky.B:0 "The Terror shall continue. Enemies of the People beware!"

ganga_revolution.301.name:0 "Treachery against the Revolution"
ganga_revolution.301.desc1:0 "[Root.GetEventAdvisorName], [Root.GetUsableName]'s Chief [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle], has often been critical of the Reign of Terror unleashed by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the revolutionary government. In the eyes of the Committee of Public Safety, this makes [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] a dangerous reactionary and an Enemy of the People, one that it would be dangerous to leave alive."
ganga_revolution.301.desc2:0 "It is not clear what Chief [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle] [Root.GetEventAdvisorName] did to attract the ire of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but the Committee of Public Safety has nevertheless identified [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] as a potential reactionary. Just in case their suspicions are accurate, they recommend execution by guillotine."
ganga_revolution.301.desc3:0 "It seems that one of the members of the Committee of Public Safety overheard [Root.GetEventAdvisorName], [Root.GetUsableName]'s Chief [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle], making incriminating remarks to a suspected counter-revolutionary. No sooner was this reported then the Committee took the step of branding [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim] an Enemy of the People and recommending execution by guillotine."

ganga_revolution.301.B:0 "We shall spare [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim]."

ganga_revolution.303.desc:0 "The frequent purges have left enemies of the Revolution cowering in terror. None dare raise their voice in opposition to the course set by the government, leaving the country as united as never before. All praise to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
ganga_revolution.303.A:0 "If they cannot love us, let them fear us."

ganga_revolution.5.female:0 "Since the Revolution, the Queen and the rest of the royal family have been kept under house arrest in the Delhi Palace, where she has been turned into a reluctant puppet of the new regime. Although she had promised to guarantee the social advancements of the Revolution, she did not hide her contempt towards this filthy constitutional monarchy that had been imposed on her, and instead plotted to escape and seek refuge with our enemies in [flee_to_country.GetUsableName], from where she hoped she might be restored to the throne. However, revolutionary forces intercepted her before she could cross the border.\n\nThis has emboldened all those who despise the monarchy and wish to permanently rid us of their scourge. They have hauled her before the National Assembly to face trial over charges of having conspired with foreign powers and thus being a traitor. If found guilty, she will be forced to abdicate, be stripped of all titles and face execution by guillotine. However, tensions are running high and the vote is likely be a close one."

ganga_revolution.7.B:0 "We don't want a new Ceasar"
ganga_revolution.8.desc:0 "Our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been assassinated! The royalist conspirators concealed their bomb in a barrel on a cart parked on New Ganpo Street, where Sheev Palpat had to pass on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' Nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', the bomb was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion went off just as Napoléon neared, killing him instantly."

flavor_gan.EVTNAME100:0 "The Infernal Machine"
flavor_gan.EVTDESC100:1 "There has been an attempt on the life of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The royalist conspirators concealed their bomb in a barrel on a cart parked on the Rue Saint-Nicaise, where Napoléon had to pass on the way to the Opera to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' Nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', the bomb was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoléon."
flavor_gan.EVTOPTA100:1 "A lucky escape."
flavor_gan.EVTNAME101:0 "Aspirations of an Empire"
flavor_gan.EVTDESC101:2 "Not satisfied with being merely First Consul, Sheev Palpat is proposing that he be crowned Emperor of India. He justifies this by claiming that restoring the hereditary succession would make it harder to restore the former Emperors of India to power - after all, there have been several royalist plots on his life - but there is little doubt that his prime motivation is to further his own ambitions for supreme power. The proposal has met with widespread support among the populace, who yearn for the relative stability of the pre-revolutionary years; however, diehard supporters of the Revolution express worry at this attempt to concentrate even more power in Palpat's hands."
flavor_gan.EVTOPTA101:0 "India will be an Empire once more!"
flavor_gan.EVTOPTB101:0 "The Revolution must continue!"
flavor_gan.EVTNAME110:0 "The Revolutionary Republic"
flavor_gan.EVTDESC110:1 "The wars of [Root.GetName] are a never-ending drain on the country's people. As the Republic's wars exact an ever greater toll on the commoners in the shape of high taxes, conscription and mounting death tolls, many of those who hoped their situation would be improved by the Revolution are now deceased and those who thought that the change of government would bring peace to the country seem to have lost faith in the republic."
flavor_gan.EVTOPTA110:0 "The republic will survive!"
flavor_gan.EVTDESC111:1 "Constant warfare has exhausted the population of [Root.GetName]. Those who supported the Revolution complain that they had sought to better their position, not subject themselves to a constant state of war that is having devastating effects on the general populace. Many are increasingly losing faith in the Republic as a result."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC112:0 "The change of government only seems to have increased the financial mismanagement. With the Republic of [Root.GetName] having declared bankruptcy, many of its former supporters now ask themselves if things weren't perhaps better before the Revolution..."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC113:1 "The national debt is a problem in the eyes of the people. The country's finances seem to be in no better shape than before the shift of government, and many fear a costly default or rising taxes. The faith in the Republic is dwindling and many are turning back to old monarchist ways."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC114:1 "The Revolution seems to have ground to a halt. With more than a quarter of the country in revolt, few now believe that the republican government holds the answers to our nation's problems."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC115:1 "Those who thought that the Revolution and the Republic would be the answers to the instability of [Root.GetName] are becoming more and more disillusioned. The ever-increasing turmoil afflicting our nation is causing widespread suffering among the peasantry and upper classes alike. Support is growing for a strong leader to take over control and enforce an end to the chaos."
flavor_gan.EVTDESC116:1 "The People's faith in the Republic is declining. They accuse us of putting too little effort into mending the problems of the old regime and claim that things were better off for them before the Revolution. Already, dissidents are rallying support behind those who wish to reverse our course and place a monarch on the [Root.GetAdjective] throne."
flavor_gan.EVTOPTA116:0 "Who dares question the republic!"
flavor_gan.EVTOPTB116:1 "Increase our public relief program."
flavor_gan.EVTOPTC116:0 "Cut back on diplomatic spending."

The state must ensure that the people admire the figure of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a fervent zeal bordering on worship, and thus we must produce ample propaganda to promote the image of the monarch. We must carefully consider how the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is portrayed, emphasizing only those aspects of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule that the people can see in action."
